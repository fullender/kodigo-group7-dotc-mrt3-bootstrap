          <h4 class="text-uppercase">History</h4>
          <br>
          <p align="justify">For years now, rapid growth of commuters and vehicles population have plagued Metro Manila,
            the center of Philippine socio-economic and political activity. Heavy traffic, pollution and all the
            attendant undesired results are problems that Metro Manila have to contend with daily.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">A case in point is on EDSA, a 24-kilometer stretch from MacArthur Highway at Caloocan City
            in the north of Metro Manila to Roxas Blvd., Pasay City, south of Metro Manila.Considered one of the world's
            highest volume thoroughfares, EDSA is a semi-circular ring road link with several radial roads leading to
            the metropolis' social, economical and political centers. The avenue cuts across the cities of Caloocan,
            Quezon, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay and bounds Pasig City and the town of San Juan.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">EDSA's importance to the lives of more than eight million people - or 12 percent of the
            country's 68 million citizens who live in Metro Manila cannot be underestimated. Added to the metropolis'
            growing population are the transients and migrants who come to live in Metro Manila in search of
            opportunities. Every birth, transient or migrant, is a potential commuter who will likely join more than the
            2.8 million people already using EDSA.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">At the same time, every birth, and transient or migrant, is also a potential car owner
            likely to occupy 4.6 meters by 2.7 meters, the average car area of street space. The fast pedestrian and
            vehicle population growth has become a major headache for metropolitan planners who concede that Metro
            Manila's road, which comprise less than 10 percent of the country's network, cannot adequately accommodate
            pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Streets in the metropolis expand by less than two percent annually.</p>
          <p align="justify">Statistics add that traffic has caused the loss of over P15 billion yearly due to lost
            man-hours, repairs and maintenance and lost fuel. Added to these are unquantifiable discomforts to commuters
            and vehicle owners undergo when they travel through major streets.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">At worse, heavy traffic is taking its toll on the nation's social and economic build-up.
            Traffic in Metro Manila is expected to nearly resemble nerve-wracking conditions in Bangkok, Thailand and in
            other parts of the world. Experts agree that a long term solution, beyond just keeping vehicles off the
            streets, is imperative. One of the solutions that the government sponsored was the establishment of the EDSA
            MRT3 System.

            Communication's integrated strategy to alleviate the chronic traffic congestion experience along the EDSA
            corridor. The Metro Rail system is designed to carry in excess of 23,000 passengers per hour per direction,
            initially, and is expandable to accommodate 48,000 passengers per hour, per direction.
